Guildhall is a port of Andreas Rottmann's `dorodango' package manager
for R6RS Scheme.  Dorodango is available under the GNU GPL, version 3 or
later, and is Copyright (C) 2009-2011 Andreas Rottman.

The porting work to turn Dorodango into Guildhall was done by Andy Wingo,
and is Copyright (C) 2011 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

* imported code

For resolving dependencies, guildhall employs a Scheme "port" of
aptitude's solver, from the Debian project. The code is based on
aptitude changeset 3258:f952da7ee794, Copyright (C) 2005, 2007-2009,
Daniel Burrows, licensed under the GPL, version 2 or later. Guildhall
also takes some inspiration from aptitude's command line user interface,
mostly in the form of similiar wording of messages.

Guildhall also includes a number of external Scheme libraries which
have their own licenses, all of them compatible with the GPLv3+.  Here
is a list of those libraries, their files, and their licenses.  If a
file does not appear in this list, it is probably under the GPLv3+,
though the header on the file will tell you for sure.

See the COPYING.* files for the full licenses.
