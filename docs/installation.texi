@section Installation

Sigil comes in a standard GNU tarball, and so the normal package
installation techniques apply:

@example
tar -xjf @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}.tar.bz2
cd @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}/sigil
./configure
make
make check
# become root
make install
@end example

Note that this assumes that you have installed Guile into the default
prefix for @command{./configure}, which is usually @code{/usr/local}.
It is recommended to install sigil into the same prefix as your
Guile installation, so if you installed Guile to @code{/usr}, add
@code{--prefix=/usr} after to your @code{./configure} invocation.

After running installing Sigil, you should now be able to
run @command{guild config --help}, which displays a help message.
