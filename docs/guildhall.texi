Guildhall is a package manager written for Guile Scheme.

A guild is an association of independent craftspeople.  This guildhall
marks you as a member of the guild of Guile wizards and journeyfolk.

On a practical level, Guildhall lets you share Scheme modules and programs
over the internet, and install code that has been shared by others.
Guildhall can handle dependencies, so when a program requires several
libraries, and each of those has further dependencies, all of the
prerequisites for the program can be installed in one go.

Guildhall is a port of Andreas Rottmann's Dorodango portable package
manager for R6RS Scheme, adapted to better fit in with Guile Scheme
environments.  It is compatible with the R6RS Scheme package archives
that Dorodango uses.
