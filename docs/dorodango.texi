Dorodango is a package manager written in and for R6RS Scheme.

From @uref{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorodango,Wikipedia}:

@quotation
Dorodango is a Japanese art form in which earth and water are molded
to create a delicate shiny sphere, resembling a marble or billiard
ball.
@end quotation

Using dorodango, you can easily install and distribute collections of
R6RS libraries as well as programs using these libraries. It can
handle dependencies, so when a program requires several libraries, and
each of those has further dependencies, dorodango allows you to
install all the prerequisites for that program in one go.
