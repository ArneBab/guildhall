dorodango is (intended to be) a package manager for R6RS
implementations. Its main concepts are outlined in this thread:
<http://groups.google.com/group/ikarus-users/browse_thread/thread/fabb890e3015f6f1>.

Currently, it is not useable -- I just put the code oneline so
interested developers can track its progress and chime in. Any help or
feedback is welcome!

=== Solver =============================================================

For resolving dependencies, dorodango employs a Scheme "port" of
aptitude's [0] solver. The code is based on aptitude changeset
